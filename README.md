# ELE-302
This repository is for all of the work I've done in ELE-302 (Electric Networks) F2020, the course expands on ELE-202 which covers the fundemental principles of electric circuit analysis.  

ELE-302 is a Ryerson University course that is mandatory for Computer Engineering students during 3rd semester; I've taken this course during F2020. I would also like to recuse myself of any academic misconduct because the purpose of this repository is to simply show my work, so please do not directly copy.  

The application that I've used throughout the course would be Multisim.
